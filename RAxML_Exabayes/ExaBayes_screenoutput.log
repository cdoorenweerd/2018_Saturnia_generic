This is the multi-threaded MPI hybrid variant of ExaBayes (version 1.5),
a tool for Bayesian MCMC sampling of phylogenetic trees, build with the
Phylogenetic Likelihood Library (version 1.0.0, September 2013).

This software has been released on 2016-09-24 13:24:08
(git commit id:ef87cd16821f979075dcc20c870298d87406f146)

	by Andre J. Aberer, Kassian Kobert and Alexandros Stamatakis

#patterns:	1075
type:		DNA

Parameter names will reference the above partition numbers.

================================================================

Starting MCMC sampling using the AVX implementation for likelihood computations.
ExaBayes will run until topological convergence is achieved
(ASDSF < 2.00%, at least 1000000 generations).
ExaBayes will print log-likelihoods of all chains, grouped by
run id (separated by '=') and sorted by heat (starting with the
cold chain). First column indicates generation number (completed
by all chains) and the time elapsed for this increment.
