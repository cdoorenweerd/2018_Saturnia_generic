### ABSTRACT

#### Aim
There is growing evidence that the North Atlantic Land Bridge may have had a significant, underappreciated, role in structuring northern hemispheric biodiversity. Understanding the biogeography of less vagile animals with specific habitat requirements could provide fine-scale information about the duration and environmental conditions of both the North Atlantic Land Bridge and the Bering Land Bridge.

#### Location
Asia, Europe and North America

#### Taxon
<i>Saturnia</i> giant silkmoths. The genus has a relictual distribution from the Neogene, with species and subgenera endemic to sub-regions across the Northern Hemisphere.

#### Methods
We sequenced six genes totaling 4,674 base pairs from representatives of all subgenera, and augmented this with publicly available COI sequences to build a dataset covering 34 <i>Saturnia</i> species--about half of the described species. Datasets were subjected to phylogenetic, molecular dating and biogeographic analyses.

#### Results
We found that adding a ‘Jump’ parameter to a Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC) model results in contradictory biogeographic inferences, with the Jump dispersal model being more biologically plausible for <i>Saturnia</i>. We found that <i>Saturnia</i> has a much earlier origin in North America than previously thought, and from there colonized Europe. The most parsimonious scenario involves a relatively recent (19.6–11.7 Ma) transit across the North Atlantic Land Bridge, and subsequent dispersal across all of Eurasia. Without Jump dispersal, <i>Saturnia</i> biogeography requires complex patterns of in-situ extinction and recolonization followed by bursts of dispersal and speciation.

#### Main conclusions
Although it is difficult to verify the appropriate model through fossil data or tectonic histories, allowing Jump dispersal in <i>Saturnia</i> moth biogeography invokes far fewer assumptions and suggests the use of both Beringia and the North Atlantic Land bridge; suggesting the importance of the latter for other groups may be underestimated.
